# Employee-Tracker
Employee-Tracker

For this assignment, We were tasked with creating a program that generates a database with employee information based on the user's input.

### Prerequisites

In order to get started using the Employee Tracker, you'll need to have Node installed, you'll need to run the "npm i" command to install the necessary dependancies, and you'll need to change the "connection" variable in index.js to reflect your own username and password.

## Getting Started

Once you've completed all the necessary prerequisites, you can start using the Employee Tracker. And in order to show you how to use it, I've included an instructional video that takes you through the steps of generating your own custom employee database. The video will be linked below, along with a step by step explanation.

If you need a little additional instruction, don't worry. Here's how it works:
The first thing you'll wanna do after opening up your terminal is run the command "node index.js"

After entering the "node index.js" command, the program will initialize and you will be prompted as follows:

From here you can navigate to your preferred option and the program will respond accordingly. 

If you choose one the options to view existing data you will see a response that looks like one of these:

You can also add to the existing data, in which case you will have to answer a series of prompts that look something like this:

Just input your answer to each prompt question and your input will be saved and stored in the database.

In addition to adding new data, you can also modify existing data. You have the option of updating an existing employees role.
